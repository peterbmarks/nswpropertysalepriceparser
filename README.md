 # NSW Property Sale Price formatter

 This code takes the sale price report zip files from https://valuation.property.nsw.gov.au/embed/propertySalesInformation and turns them into a csv file that can be opened in a spreadsheet program.

 The latest version is at https://github.com/peterbmarks/nswpropertysalepriceparser

 Download recent zip files and place them in a Downloads directory next to priceparser.py and run it.
